# Chapter 6 Vector Semantics and Embeddings

* **DEF** **distributional hypothesis** Words that occur in similar contexts tend to have similar meanings.
* **DEF** **vector semantics** instantiate the hypothesis by learning representations of the meaning of words, or **embeddings,** from their distributions in texts.
* **DEF** **representation learning** is about automatically learning useful representations of the input text.
