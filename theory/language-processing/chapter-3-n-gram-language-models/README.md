# Chapter 3 N-gram Language Models

How to predict words someone is going to say? Sometimes we have to identify words in noisy input, for example in **speech recognition**, **spelling correction**, **grammatical error correction** or **machine translation**. Word prediction is also important in **augmentative and alternative communication / AAC**.

**DEF** **Language models / LMs** are models that assign probabilities to sequence of words.
