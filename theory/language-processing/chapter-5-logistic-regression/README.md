# Chapter 5 Logistic Regression

* Different from Naive Bayes which is a generative classifier, Logistic Regression is a discriminative classifier. 
  * Generative model learns how a document of specific class is generated, or the distribution of documents over classes.
    * > Given a test image, the system then asks whether itâ€™s the cat model or the dog model that better fits \(is less surprised by\) the image, and chooses that as its label.
  * Discriminative model extracts features of different classes of documents that are the most helpful when classifying documents, instead of learning features on the whole.
